# üç≥ Chef Claude

Chef Claude is a React app that suggests recipes based on the
ingredients you enter. You type in what you have on hand, and the app
will use AI (Anthropic Claude or HuggingFace Mistral) to generate a
recipe. The recipe is displayed directly on the page in a simple and
readable format. \## Features - Add ingredients one at a time and see
them listed - Once you have at least 4 ingredients, a **Get a recipe**
button appears - Clicking the button sends your ingredients to an AI
model (Claude or Mistral) - The AI replies with a recipe suggestion -
Recipes are displayed clearly using markdown rendering - Clean and
minimal interface, styled with CSS \## Project Structure
